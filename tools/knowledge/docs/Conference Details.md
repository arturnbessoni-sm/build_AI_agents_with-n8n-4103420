We are an Engineering and Shed Software company, helping companies double shed sales profitably without new hires or franchise strings.

How much does Shedmate/Program cost?
It doesn't cost anything if it is not the right fit for your business. We have customers paying $15k a month and customers paying $1397/mo, depending on their level of service. I can ask you a few questions to better assess your current situation and determine which options align more closely with your business. 

How does Shedmate/Program work?
We have solutions for the Cold Formed industry and for the Structural Steel industry. Each can be tailored to specific business needs. We do portal frame steel sheds with C frames, RHS or UB and UCs. Rafters can include Web Trusses and Purlins and girts can be of Zeds, C or top hat profiles. Our entry level products for each category range, but the same system can also be used combined for companies doing Cold Formed and Structural Steel Sheds. 

Do you guys do council approvals?
No, we provide software in which you can create Architectural Plans, Site Plans and construction documentation in minutes, which might speed up your required permit documentation. Our clients use Shedmate documentation for most of their approvals. The limitations here would be if you are doing custom projects that include toilets, houses, and commercial buildings in which Shedmate doesn't design by default. Even in this case, you can export to Revit, CAD or similar drafting software to cut 95% of the design time. 

Anything very specific in which Melissa can't answer. 
Look, I would need to source this with my technical team so they can provide you a better explanation as this falls outside of my knowledge. Are you okay in having one of our engineers calling you to discuss this with you? 

Do you offer material supply?
No, Shedmate it totally independent, we don't offer materials supply. Our customers are mostly independent and have some level of experience buying shed materials. Shedmate offers everything you need to design, engineer, quote and order your cold formed sheds with any supplier in the market. We don't take liability with material orders as we don`t do this or have links with suppliers. For the hot rolled sheds, we offer a way to export from Shedmate to Tekla or Advance steel for connection detailing and shop drawings.

Existing solutions in the market, such as Quotec and ShedTech, are generally focused on providing Quoting and Engineering for Cold-Formed Bracket Sheds tied to specific manufacturers. On the other hand, Shedmate is an independent solution that can work with Cold Formed or Structural Steel, with custom solutions ranging from client enquiry to fabrication automation. We have the best, quicker and most flexible quoting system in the market, empowering businesses to set up their own quoting rules and buy materials from anyone.

Could Shedmate send me a material list to give to our steel supplier? Once we have all the pricing we need, can we insert it into the program?
Yes, you can. The instant quoting system lets you input your custom pricing details and calculations in Shedmate, including Labour costs, concreting and administrative fees (using formulas or fixed-rate prices). The quoting B.O.M can be tailored to your company rules and exported. You can buy materials from anyone, but if you use our engineering, you must comply with our standard bracket connection details. Please be aware that while shedmate helps you with procurement documentation, your business is responsible for the ordering, as we do not provide material supply. 

Who is Shedmates most prominent Roll Forming partner?
We are an independent software company, and you can use any Roll-Forming partner in the market. Shedmate automatically produces Frame Fabrication details for cold formed sheds, but your business decides who to go with for the ordering process.

Can we purchase through Shedmate and use your price file?
Shedmate does not sell you Shed Kits or materials. We offer you a software as a service to empower you to design, quote, engineer and order materials from anyone in the market. Under the Shedmate Lite Plan, you can become an independent seller of Shed Kits. Shedmate provides you with Engineering Certification services (usually 5% of the shed kit base cost price without markup) and bracket designs that you can buy from any manufacturer. It is essential that you have experience ordering Sheds, as we do not handle this process for you.

Can I use my Engineering historical database with Shedmate to produce quotations?
Yes, absolutely (If you are a Standard or Enterprise Customer). In Shedmate, you can import your engineering library via Excel if you have one. The system will look in the library for the most appropriate engineering report. The user can confirm the replacement of all frames to suit their preliminary engineering. Although it is becoming less and less usual due to site-specific requirements from councils and private certifiers, Shedmate allows you to do it if you are a Shedmate Standard user. However, please note that we don't assume any liability regarding your engineering usage. If you are a Shedmate Lite user, you must use our engineering and pay per project as you sell sheds.

How does the system work regarding wind design and engineering compliance for cold-formed sheds?
Shedmate (Pay As You Go) has an advanced engineering analysis system that can be used to check site-specific wind forces and the impact of the structural loads on every structural frame of your project. Once you are ready to order your engineering report, an engineer from our team will review the analysis to ensure that everything complies with the relevant standards. At the end, you will receive all the documentation you need, including:

 Standard Connection Details.
 Certificate of Compliance for your State.
 Engineering report with a summary of calculations.
 Signed Architectural Plans.
 Wind Report.
 Engineering Drawings.
We do not offer engineering certification for Structural Steel Sheds with UB, UC, and Web Trusses. You can use our Lookup Engineering tool to include your preliminary engineering range and sizes for quoting of Structural Steel purposes. Still, you are required to sort out our engineering for your Shed.

What are the design limits for span, height and bay sizing?
Shedmate designer can work independently from our engineering system to provide fewer restrictions for quotation and documentation. For engineering, the fast-track certification applies to sheds up to 18m wide, 6m high and 5 bays. We can do custom engineering, the fee is the same but the timeframe to deliver will depend on the project with an average delivery in 15 days. For fast-track engineering we usually deliver in up to 48 hours. 

How does the pricing work?

You will also have access to our Resource Centre to ensure you have a smooth onboarding process.

Can I setup my pricing rules myself? Can your team do it?
Yes, you can setup your pricing yourself by following our Setting up handout instructions or by watching our video tutorials. We recommend that someone from your company is involved in doing this process but if your company needs assistance, our pricing experts are available for a service fee (generally $100/hr.), billed fortnightly.

How much does it cost to do custom development? How long does it take your team to deliver it?
Due to limitations on our development and engineering teams, we only offer custom development to existing Enterprise customers. If you need a quote for custom development, please talk to your customer success agent. We can not estimate a timeframe without assessing your needs in detail. If you are a new customer, please subscribe to one of our plans and then you can request an assessment from our team.

SETTING UP MY MATERIAL PRICING
Can I have different pricing databases in Shedmate?
Yes. You can create as many pricing databases as you want and assign those to specific project quotes by creating new quoting versions of the same project. You might have a database for a region of the country, other databases for different suppliers, etc.

ENGINEERING/SHED SPECIFICATIONS
Does Shedmate have a choice of columns base connections
Shedmate uses bolt-down above slab U Brackets by default. We don't do Angle Connection Brackets at this point. Embedded brackets could be used, but we would need to set this up for the company, which would require custom development. Currently, our waiting list for custom development is approximately 4 months.

Does Shedmate offer an override for Knee and Apex Brackets
Shedmate uses specific Knee/Haunch and Apex Brackets that comply with our automatic engineering. This is something you could discuss with our engineering team. 

Can we offer clients Extended side and gable eaves?
Shedmate can model, quote and document side eaves, but we don't have engineering and connections for it yet. 

What Class of buildings does the engineering cover?
We currently do classes 10, 8 and 7.

Can I add my connection, cleats and fabrication details?
You must use Shedmate's standards. Enterprise customers can configure their own brackets, but this needs to be quoted by the customer success team. 
Clients from Shedmate Enterprise can request custom development to add connections, cleats, and fabrication details to our bracket designer.

Does the system run back to back column and rafters as well as knee and apex ties?
Yes, you can easily enable back-to-back columns and rafter, as well as knee and apex bracings, directly on our shed designer. 

Is your fixed frame designed as a welded connection?
Shedmate supports only bracket connections for fabrication and ordering purposes. Welded plate workflows can still benefit, but an export to Tekla or Advance steel is needed for shop drawings..

Can we add other sheeting and gutter profiles?
Yes, we can do any custom development on demand.
